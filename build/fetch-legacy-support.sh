# macports-legacy-support and publishes a .pkg, and re-deriving it would be a second answer to
# "which shim is baked in?". Integrity is re-checked against the release's SHA256SUMS EVERY run, so
# a poisoned download cache cannot silently change the shipped archive.
# Prints the path of the extracted .a on stdout; everything else goes to stderr.
