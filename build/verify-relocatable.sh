# Flag any Mach-O load command (dependency / install-name / rpath) that names an absolute path the
# INSTALLED toolchain will not have.
#
# The obvious offender is the build scratch dir ($WORK): a dylib whose install_name still points into
# ~/.cache builds fine and dies on the first machine that is not this one. But the subtler and more
# likely one is a BUILD-HOST PACKAGE MANAGER: CMake happily finds /opt/pkg (pkgsrc) or /opt/homebrew
# (a GHA runner) while probing for zstd/zlib/libedit and bakes that path into clang's load commands.
# The result ships, installs, and fails at first launch on a user's machine with a missing dylib --
# which a $WORK-only grep would never have caught. So the rule is a WHITELIST, not a blacklist:
#
#   allowed: @rpath/@loader_path/@executable_path (relative by construction)
#            /usr/lib/**, /System/**             (present on every macOS)
#            $NATIVE_PREFIX/**, $CROSS_PREFIX/** (our own install locations -- the pkgs put us there)
#   flagged: every other absolute path
#
# BOTH prefixes are allowed regardless of which variant is being audited. The alternative -- passing
# in the one prefix that applies -- buys nothing (a native binary cannot legitimately reference the
# cross prefix anyway, and the two are distinct paths) and costs a whole class of silent failure: a
# caller that forgets to set it leaves the pattern empty, "" /* matches every absolute path, and the
# gate passes everything while appearing to run.
